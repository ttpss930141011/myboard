# Commit Message Rewrite Guide

## Instructions

To rewrite the commit messages while preserving the code changes, you can use interactive rebase. Here are the proper commit messages for each commit:

### Option 1: Interactive Rebase (Recommended)

```bash
# Start interactive rebase from before the first commit to change
git rebase -i 464df052e569172c923a2bdd3826cbfd85d8ccd1^

# In the editor, change 'pick' to 'reword' for each commit you want to rename
# Save and close, then you'll be prompted to enter new messages one by one
```

### Option 2: Using git filter-branch (Advanced)

```bash
# Create a backup branch first
git checkout -b backup-branch

# Go back to your working branch
git checkout refeactor/remove-livestocks-and-convex
```

## After Rewriting

Once you've rewritten all commits, you'll need to force push:

```bash
# Force push the rewritten history
git push --force-with-lease origin refeactor/remove-livestocks-and-convex
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Force pushing rewrites history. Make sure no one else is working on this branch.

## Alternative: Squash and Merge

If rewriting history is too complex, you can simply squash all commits when merging the PR:

```bash
# When merging the PR, use squash and merge with this message:
